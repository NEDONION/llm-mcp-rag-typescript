"Interstellar" is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is becoming uninhabitable due to climate disasters and food shortages, the film follows a former NASA pilot named Cooper who joins a mission to find a new habitable planet.

Cooper, along with scientists Amelia Brand, Doyle, and Romilly, travels through a wormhole near Saturn to explore potentially life-supporting planets in another galaxy. Time dilation, black holes, and fifth-dimensional space play key roles in the narrative.

The film blends complex physics with emotional storytelling, especially focusing on the bond between Cooper and his daughter Murphy. Murphy grows up to be a brilliant scientist working to solve gravity equations to save humanity.

"Interstellar" was praised for its ambition, visual effects, and scientific accuracy, with input from physicist Kip Thorne. It won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and is considered a modern sci-fi classic.
